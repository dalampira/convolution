# convolution

This program computes 1D convolutions in Python.
The program creates a vector of random numbers A of length N> 10, where N input will be requested by the user.
Also, it constructs a vector B = [1⁄5 (1) ⁄5 1⁄5 1⁄5 1⁄5] and then it calls a MyConvolve function with arguments A and B that
calculates the result C of the convergence between the input arguments.

Using the MyConvolve function of A.1 we calculate the result of the convergence between the sample_audio.wav and pink_noise.wav audio 
files given and we write the result to the new pinkNoise_sampleAudio.wav audio file.
Then, we create our own white noise signal, calculate the result of its convergence
with sample_audio.wav and we write it to the new whiteNoise_sampleAudio.wav audio file.
